# SARMS — Build & Install Guide
# React + Vite + PHP + MySQL on XAMPP

## What You Have
- A proper React project (not CDN-based)
- PHP backend that saves everything to MySQL in real time
- Works on XAMPP on your PC

---

## STEP 1 — Install Node.js (if not already done)
Download from https://nodejs.org — choose the LTS version.
After installing, open Command Prompt and check:
  node --version   (should show v18 or higher)
  npm --version    (should show 9 or higher)

---

## STEP 2 — Set Up the Project Folder
Copy the sarms-react folder you downloaded to anywhere on your PC.
Example: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\sarms-react\

The folder should contain:
  package.json
  vite.config.js
  index.html
  src\
      main.jsx
      App.jsx
  htaccess-for-dist.txt

---

## STEP 3 — Install Dependencies
Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell).
Navigate to the project folder:
  cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\sarms-react

Run:
  npm install

This downloads React and Vite (about 30 seconds, needs internet).

---

## STEP 4 — Build the App
Still in the same folder, run:
  npm run build

This creates a "dist" folder with optimised HTML, CSS and JS files.
It takes about 10-20 seconds.

---

## (Optional) Faster Dev Workflow — for making code changes

If you're actively editing the app (not just running it), building after every
change is slow. Instead:

1. Copy the "api" folder into a subfolder of C:\xampp\htdocs\ once, e.g.
   C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms-react\api\  (the folder name matters — see step 2)
2. Open vite.config.js and check the "server.proxy" target matches that exact
   folder name (http://localhost/sarms-react). If your XAMPP folder is named
   something else (e.g. sarms-reactt with a double t), change it here too —
   otherwise every API call will silently fail.
3. Make sure XAMPP's Apache + MySQL are both running (Step 5 below).
4. In your PROJECT source folder (not htdocs — this can be anywhere, e.g.
   your Desktop), run:
     npm install      (only needed once, or after pulling new dependencies)
     npm run dev
5. Open the URL it prints — normally http://localhost:5173 — NOT
   http://localhost/sarms-react. The dev server runs on its own port and
   proxies API calls through to XAMPP; opening the project folder directly
   through Apache (localhost/sarms-react/) will 404 on main.jsx, because
   Apache can't run unbuilt JSX.
6. When you're done and ready to deploy, run `npm run build` and follow
   Step 7 onward below as normal — the dev workflow is just for editing.

---

## STEP 5 — Set Up XAMPP
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click START next to Apache
3. Click START next to MySQL
   Both should turn green.

## STEP 5B — Set Up the AI Tutor / AI Assistant (Gemini)

The AI Tutor (student side) and AI Assistant (teacher side) need a Google
Gemini API key to work. Everything else in the app works fine without this
step — skip it for now if you just want to test the rest first.

1. Get a free API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey (sign in with
   a Google account, click "Create API key").
2. In `C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms-reactt\api\`, copy `gemini_config.example.php`
   and rename the copy to `gemini_config.php`.
3. Open `gemini_config.php` in Notepad and replace `your_api_key_here` with
   the real key you copied. Save it.
4. That's it — no rebuild needed, since this is a PHP file read directly by
   Apache, not part of the React build.

IMPORTANT: `gemini_config.php` holds a real secret. Don't share it, don't
email it, don't commit it anywhere public. If you ever suspect it's been
seen by someone else, delete the key in Google AI Studio and generate a new
one.

If you'd rather not have the key sitting in a file at all, you can instead
set a real Windows environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Control
Panel → System → Advanced → Environment Variables) and restart Apache — the
app checks for that first and only falls back to `gemini_config.php` if it's
not set.

To confirm it's working: log in as a student, open "My Learning," click
"Ask AI Tutor," and send a message. If you see an error mentioning "API key
not configured," double check steps 2-3 above.

## STEP 6 — Create the Database
1. Open browser → go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Click "Import" in the top menu
3. Click "Choose File" → select "sarms_database.sql"
4. Scroll down, click "Go"
5. You will see "sarms_db" appear in the left panel

---

## STEP 7 — Copy Files to XAMPP
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: C:\xampp\htdocs\
3. Create a new folder called: sarms
4. Open the "dist" folder from Step 4
5. Copy EVERYTHING inside dist\ into C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\
   (copy index.html, assets folder, etc.)

6. Also copy the "api" folder into C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\
   So you have: C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\api\db.php

7. Rename htaccess-for-dist.txt to .htaccess
   Then copy it into C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\
   (If Windows won't let you rename with a dot, use Command Prompt:
    rename htaccess-for-dist.txt .htaccess)

Final folder should look like:
  C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\
      index.html
      assets\
          index-abc123.js
          index-abc123.css
      api\
          db.php
      .htaccess

---

## STEP 8 — Test the PHP API First
Before opening the app, test that PHP can reach the database.
Open browser and go to:
  http://localhost/sarms/api/db.php?action=ping

You should see:
  {"ok":true,"php":"8.x","db":"sarms_db"}

If you see that — everything is working.
If you see a 404 — db.php is in the wrong folder.
If you see a DB error — re-check Step 6.

---

## STEP 9 — Open the App
Go to: http://localhost/sarms

The app will load, connect to MySQL, and show the login page.

Default login:
  Email   : admin@school.com
  Password: admin@2024

IMPORTANT: Change these immediately after first login!
Go to Settings → My Profile → change name, email and password.

---

## STEP 10 — Configure Your School
After logging in as admin:
1. Go to Settings → Institution
2. Enter your school name, address, principal name
3. Upload your school logo and principal signature
4. Save Changes

All changes save to MySQL instantly and survive page reloads.

## Troubleshooting

PROBLEM: Browser shows "Database Connection Failed"
FIX: Check Step 8 — test the ping URL first.
     Make sure api\db.php exists inside C:\xampp\htdocs\sarms\api\

PROBLEM: Page shows 404 when refreshing
FIX: The .htaccess file is missing or mod_rewrite is not enabled.
     Open C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf
     Find: AllowOverride None (inside the htdocs Directory block)
     Change to: AllowOverride All
     Restart Apache in XAMPP.

PROBLEM: npm install fails
FIX: Check your internet connection. npm needs internet to download packages.
     Try: npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org

PROBLEM: 'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command
FIX: node_modules isn't installed yet in this folder. Run "npm install"
     first, then try "npm run dev" or "npm run build" again.

PROBLEM: Browser console shows "Failed to load resource: main.jsx 404"
FIX: You're opening the raw project folder directly through Apache/XAMPP
     instead of a built one. Apache can't run unbuilt .jsx files. Either:
     (a) run "npm run build" and serve the "dist" folder's contents instead
         (see Step 7), or
     (b) use "npm run dev" and open the printed localhost:5173 URL, not
         the XAMPP URL — see the "Faster Dev Workflow" section above.

PROBLEM: Build fails with syntax error
FIX: Make sure Node.js is version 18 or higher.
     Run: node --version

PROBLEM: db.php shows blank page
FIX: Open C:\xampp\php\php.ini
     Find: display_errors = Off
     Change to: display_errors = On
     Restart Apache. Then open db.php?action=ping again.

## For WizHosting (Live Server)
After npm run build:
1. Upload everything inside dist\ to public_html\ via File Manager or FTP
2. Upload api\db.php to public_html\api\db.php
3. Create the database in cPanel → MySQL Databases
4. Import sarms_database.sql via cPanel phpMyAdmin
5. Edit api\db.php — change DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME to your cPanel values
6. Rename htaccess-for-dist.txt to .htaccess and upload to public_html\
7. Visit https://yourdomain.com
